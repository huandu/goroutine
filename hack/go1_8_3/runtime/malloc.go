// Memory allocator.
//
// This was originally based on tcmalloc, but has diverged quite a bit.
// http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html

// The main allocator works in runs of pages.
// Small allocation sizes (up to and including 32 kB) are
// rounded to one of about 70 size classes, each of which
// has its own free set of objects of exactly that size.
// Any free page of memory can be split into a set of objects
// of one size class, which are then managed using a free bitmap.
//
// The allocator's data structures are:
//
//	fixalloc: a free-list allocator for fixed-size off-heap objects,
//		used to manage storage used by the allocator.
//	mheap: the malloc heap, managed at page (8192-byte) granularity.
//	mspan: a run of pages managed by the mheap.
//	mcentral: collects all spans of a given size class.
//	mcache: a per-P cache of mspans with free space.
//	mstats: allocation statistics.
//
// Allocating a small object proceeds up a hierarchy of caches:
//
//	1. Round the size up to one of the small size classes
//	   and look in the corresponding mspan in this P's mcache.
//	   Scan the mspan's free bitmap to find a free slot.
//	   If there is a free slot, allocate it.
//	   This can all be done without acquiring a lock.
//
//	2. If the mspan has no free slots, obtain a new mspan
//	   from the mcentral's list of mspans of the required size
//	   class that have free space.
//	   Obtaining a whole span amortizes the cost of locking
//	   the mcentral.
//
//	3. If the mcentral's mspan list is empty, obtain a run
//	   of pages from the mheap to use for the mspan.
//
//	4. If the mheap is empty or has no page runs large enough,
//	   allocate a new group of pages (at least 1MB) from the
//	   operating system. Allocating a large run of pages
//	   amortizes the cost of talking to the operating system.
//
// Sweeping an mspan and freeing objects on it proceeds up a similar
// hierarchy:
//
//	1. If the mspan is being swept in response to allocation, it
//	   is returned to the mcache to satisfy the allocation.
//
//	2. Otherwise, if the mspan still has allocated objects in it,
//	   it is placed on the mcentral free list for the mspan's size
//	   class.
//
//	3. Otherwise, if all objects in the mspan are free, the mspan
//	   is now "idle", so it is returned to the mheap and no longer
//	   has a size class.
//	   This may coalesce it with adjacent idle mspans.
//
//	4. If an mspan remains idle for long enough, return its pages
//	   to the operating system.
//
// Allocating and freeing a large object uses the mheap
// directly, bypassing the mcache and mcentral.
//
// Free object slots in an mspan are zeroed only if mspan.needzero is
// false. If needzero is true, objects are zeroed as they are
// allocated. There are various benefits to delaying zeroing this way:
//
//	1. Stack frame allocation can avoid zeroing altogether.
//
//	2. It exhibits better temporal locality, since the program is
//	   probably about to write to the memory.
//
//	3. We don't zero pages that never get reused.
